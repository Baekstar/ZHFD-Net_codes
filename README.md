# ZHFD-Net: Zero-Shot Image Dehazing via High-Frequency Enhancement and Depth-Guided Optimization

## Abstract
Image dehazing is an important problem in computer vision that still faces numerous challenges due to data scarcity, particularly under unsupervised and zero-shot learning frameworks. Existing zero-shot dehazing methods exhibit certain limitations in detail restoration and handling non-uniform hazy scenes. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a zero-shot image dehazing method based on high-frequency enhancement and depth guidance. By introducing a high-frequency enhancement module and a depth estimation module, the proposed method improves dehazing performance and enhances the model's adaptability to complex hazy scenarios. Specifically, the overall architecture of the proposed model consists of two main phases, namely dehazing and rehazing phases, which integrate multi-scale feature adaptive fusion and enhancement mechanisms. Moreover, the model parameters are optimized through an appropriate depth-aware loss function, while ensuring consistency between rehazed images and the original hazy images to further enhance dehazing effectiveness.
Extensive experiments, carried out on several datasets, demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significant advancements in improving image clarity, detail restoration, and robustness in non-uniform hazy scenes.
